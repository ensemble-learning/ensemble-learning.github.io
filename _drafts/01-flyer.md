# Understanding electrochemistry from atomic scale: application of "computational experiment" in carbon dioxide reduction and oxygen reduction.

Abstract: Atomic scale simulation is of great help in extending our understanding about reaction mechanism by providing "in situ" atomic details during reaction. However, the time scale and size scale of "computational experiment" is far beyond the capacity of brute force simulation. In this work, we combined quantum mechanic calculations with advanced sampling method (metadynamics, thermal integration and accelerate molecular dynamics) and empirical molecule mechanic to drive the chemical reactions and reach nanoparticle catalysis in realistic scale, which enables simulation of electrochemistry reaction at electrolyte/electrode interface. Taking carbon dioxide reaction (CO2RR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as examples, we demonstrated that "computational experiment" can reveal the mystery and provide new insight about the electrochemical reaction by providing the panorama of a complete reaction map. Moreover, taking the knowledge we learned from simulation as guideline, it is possible to design new catalysis prior to experiment and finally achieve it by closely collaborating with experimetist.
