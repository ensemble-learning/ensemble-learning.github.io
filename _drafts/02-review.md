It is a difficult decision. However, I have to recommend to rejecting this manuscript, because I consider this work is merely a small extension of their previous published work.

I am not an experiment expert, but I have experience on graphene based materials and have at least paper published. My comments are, therefore, mainly focus on the general interest from material science.

In this work, the authors reported a experiment method to improve the performance of activated carbon by applying a post-stage acidic rinse. They found a 27% increase in gravimetric capacitance. However, their experiment results are not surprising for me at all, because a acidic rinse is a commonly used pretreatment to remove impurities. Meanwhile, I also notice that the authors have published a very similar research with a title of "Preparation and characterization of super activated carbon produced from gulfweed by KOH activation". It seems that the only difference is that HF is used in this work instead of HCl. I, therefore, consider the research reported here is merely a small extension of their previous work.
