In this work, the authors reported the oxidation of eight pharmaceutical micropollutants by chloroperoxidase. They found that chloroperoxidase can oxidize all the tested micropollutants. Furthermore, as they immobilized the enzyme on substrate, a better resistant
 of pH was observed, although the oxidation performance decreased in some cases (ketorolac for example). Basing on these experiments, the authors concluded that chloroperoxidase represents a promising catalyst.

I only have one minor comment:
Figure 4 shows that in the case of 17b-Estradiol no treatment is better than enzymatic treatment, which seems to be contrast to the author's conclusion that chloroperoxidase have a positive effect in oxidizing all the micro pollutants. I suggest more explanations.
