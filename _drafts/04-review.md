I suggest a major revision.

I am a computational chemist, and my research interest covers a wide range of material and energy problems. I have experience in ORR reaction, and have two paper published in this area. One is reaction mechanism of ORR by using density functional theory published in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., and the other is a joint work by collaborating with experiment published in science. Thus, I am familiar with this area.

In this work, the authors summarized current progress of high efficient metal clusters catalysis towards ORR, which includes single metal (Pt, Au, Ag and Pd) and alloys (such as Ru-Pt). In the end, the authors raised three challenges:
1. How to remove surface ligand;
2. How to precisely anchor metal cluster on support;
3. How to reduce the cost.

My comments are as follows:
1. Despite of three decades research, the reaction mechanism of ORR on Pt is still far from clear. Several possible reaction mechanism has been proposed basing on experiment observations and theorical calculations. Here, in the section 2, the authors only consider one possibilities, which seems to be arbitrary, especially for a review paper. I, thus, recommend the authors to add more proposed mechanism for a completeness.
Actually, the reaction mechanism the authors cited is not the well accepted one. In this mechanism, O2 is first reduce to H2O2, and H2O2 is further reduced to H2O by a 2e- reaction. However, it is already well accepted that no H2O2 is ever observed in Pt catalysis. Thus, a more reasonable reaction mechanism is as follows:
O2 ==> HO2 ==> O ==> OH ==> H2O2
2. The reaction mechanism of ORR in alkaline is even more intrigue. For example, it is still puzzling that why ORR in alkaline electrolyte is much worse than that in acidic electrolyte. Thus, I recommend the authors to include papers in this direction for completeness.
3. I suggest the authors to re-plot the tables and figures instead of directly cutting the tables (table 1 and 2) and figures from the original papers, which will highly improve the resolution and quality of paper. For example, figure 1 is capital A to D, but figure 2 is lower case A to D.
4. I suggest the authors to put all the performance in one table (single metal and alloy), which makes the comparisons of performance much easier.
5. The authors consider the cost as one further challenge. However, I didn't find any information about the cost in this paper. For example, which the cost requires for large-scale industrial applation and what is the cost of current synthesys methods.
