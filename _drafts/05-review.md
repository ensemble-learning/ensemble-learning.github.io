In this work, the authors experimentally synthesized a series of Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 adsorbents with ordered mesoporous structure by one-pot evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA). By changing the ZnO loading, the authors found that Cu-ZnO20-Al2O3 represents the best performance (30.69). The authors attribute such improvement as a beneficial effect of ordered mesoporous structure.
However, the evidence the authors supplied is not convincing enough to support their conclusion.
The conclusions that "the ordered mesoporous structure of Cu-ZnO-Al2O3   adsorbents  could  enhance  the  desulfurization  activity" is based on the comparisons between Cu-ZnO20-Al2O3 and Cu-ZnO25-Al2O3. However, such comparison is not convincing enough, because these two systems are different in many respects, not only on structure oderness.
For example, in the case of Cu-ZnO25-Al2O3 the experiment evidence clearly show that CuAl2O4 and ZnAl2O3 formed, which are inactive phases. Thus, very possibility the loss in catalysis performance is due to the loss of active catalysis sites (Cu for example). I suggest the authors adding more explanations to clarify.


Minor comments:
1.  In table 1, there are two rows of Cu-ZnO15-Al2O3. I assume that the later case should be Cu-ZnO20-Al2O3.
2.  The texts in Figure 7 is too small to be clear.
3.  On page 27, there is a typo "make00"
