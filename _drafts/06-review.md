It is a difficult decision, however, I suggest a rejection of this work with two reasons:
1. The evidence support by the authors fail to support their conclusion.
2. This work is a merely extension of their previous work (published in catalysis letter 2017).

I am not an expert in experiment synthesis, but have experience in heterogonous catalysis. My comments is mainly based on reaction mechanism and general sense of chemistry.

In this work, the authors reported the synthesis of Cu-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst by ball milling. They characterized this catalysis by using methods including ICP, TPR, SEM and et al. The catalysis performances in CO2 reforming of ethanol were investigated at Temperatures ranging from 500 to 700 C. A 90 h on-stream aging test showed no apparent deactivation. The authors attribute the improved catalysis performance as a result of high dispersion of Cu species and the strong interaction between metal and support. 

However, the evidence the authors supplied is not strong enough to support their main conclusion: " The high behavior of the catalyst could be attributed to its high dispersion of Cu species and the strong metal-
support integration".

The authors considered the 294 TPR peak (Figure 2) as an evidence of strongly bonded Cu basing on a reference (ref 42). However, ref 42 ("A sintering and carbon-resistant Ni-SBA-15 catalyst prepared by solid-state grinding method for dry reforming of methane") has no information about the TPR of CuO. Thus, I don't think the explanation is convincing enough.
Cu-Ce0.8ZrO2 catalyst is a widely reported system. I also notice that the authors also published a similar work in 2017 (Syngas Production from Ethanol Dry Reforming over Cu/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 Catalyst). Thus, I consider this work is a merely extension of previous research.
