It is a difficult decision. However, I have to recommend to reject this manuscript, because I have difficulties in finding any clear scientific conclusion form this manuscript. Such problems come from: first, the research is not well-designed and not well-organized; second, the manuscript is not well-written.

I have experience in large scale simulations using reactive force field and energetic materials. I have at least four papers published in this areas. Thus, my comments mainly focus on the simulation and significance.

In this work, the authors conducted reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the deformation of aluminum (Al) nanoparticles and the surface reactions. They designed at least 18 systems with different ratio of explosive (RDX) and Al (or Al2O3) and different Al orientation. From these calculations, they concluded that: first, "the  interaction  between  RDX molecules  and  Al  at  the  initial  stage  does  not  affect  the  order  of  shock-induced anisotropic response of RDX"; and second, Al2O3 suppress the decomposition of RDX.
However, both of these conclusions are as expected basing on common sense. Thus, I am afraid that the work reported in this manuscript is lack of scientific significance.

For example, under such high shock velocity (2.5 km/s) the impact quickly reflect back from the substrate. Thus, it is no suppressing that the interaction between Al and RDX has little influence on the shock-induced response of RDX. I suggest the authors to consider more realist impact velocity, which gives enough time to relax the interface after initial reactions.
Al2O3 is a well-know inert surface that is able to resist further oxidation of Al. Thus, it is no suppressing that Al2O3 suppress the decomposition of RDX.
