Copper is the only elemental metal that reduces a significant fraction of CO2 to hydrocarbons and alcohols, but the atomistic reaction mechanism that controls the product distributions is not known because it has not been possible to detect the reaction intermediates on the electrode surface experimentally, or to carry out Quantum Mechanics (QM) calculations with a realistic description of the electrolyte (water). Here, we carry out QM calculations with an explicit description of water on the Cu(100) surface (experimentally shown to be stable under CO2 reduction reaction conditions) to examine the initial reaction pathways to form CO and formate (HCOOâ€“) from CO2 through free energy calculations at 298 K and pH 7.
