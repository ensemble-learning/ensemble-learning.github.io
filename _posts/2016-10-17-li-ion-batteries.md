In order to increase the energy content of lithium ion
batteries (LIBs), researchers worldwide focus on high specific energy
(Wh/kg) and energy density (Wh/L) anode and cathode materials.
However, most of the attention is primarily paid to the specific
gravimetric and/or volumetric capacities of these materials, while other
key parameters are often neglected. For practical applications, in
particular for large size battery cells, the Coulombic efficiency (CE),
voltage efficiency (VE), and energy efficiency (EE) have to be
considered, which is point out in the work of 
[**Meister et al**](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b02895) 
by comparing numerous LIB active materials.
