Challenge 1: Fuel cells and hydrogen are too expensive

The cost of hydrogen energy has always been high, but the U.S. natural gas production has increased dramatically, resulting in a much cheaper price of hydrogen than before. In addition, electrolysis can be used to decompose hydrogen into water. More importantly, the cost of hydrogen is now lower than that of gasoline. Researchers have also discovered a variety of ways to use relatively inexpensive materials when manufacturing fuel cells. At least when we talk about costs now, hydrogen energy batteries also have a certain degree of competitiveness.

Challenge 2: Storage of hydrogen is more difficult

The storage of hydrogen is challenging because hydrogen is a gas, which will inevitably lead to hydrogen storage occupying a lot of space and requiring large storage tanks with thick walls. For hydrogen energy vehicles, this is a headache. Fortunately, many companies have successfully developed a system that can be used by commercial vehicles to transport hydrogen in response to ammonia.

Challenge 3: At present, the world still focuses on petroleum fuels and weak hydrogen infrastructure

In fact, the current hydrogen infrastructure is not strong, but in many developed countries, natural gas and water infrastructure can still be seen. Both types of substances can be used to synthesize hydrogen at a cost equivalent to or slightly lower than gasoline. In this way, there is no need to use trailers for hydrogen consignment, or hydrogen can be directly generated on site.

The promotion of fuel cells has become more enforceable earlier. Not only that, but many places have begun to implement it. Toyota has successfully cooperated with Mirai, and Honda and Hyundai are also positioning hydrogen fuel vehicles and plan to compete with industry rivals.

Therefore, to do everything possible to reduce the use of petroleum fuels, the application of fuel cell technology still has a long way to go, but its ambition is to achieve emissions reduction and solve the problem of energy depletion. The future of fuel cells will be bright.
