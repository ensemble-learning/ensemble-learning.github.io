The unique physical and chemical properties and performances of nanomaterials are closely related to the interfacial tension. However, there is no method to accurately measure the interfacial tension of nanomaterials. In addition, the effect of particle size on the interfacial tension of nanoparticles is unclear, and there exist conflicting conclusions about the value and sign of Tolman length. In this paper, a novel method of determining the interfacial tension (solid–liquid and solid–gas interfaces), temperature coefficient of interfacial tension, and Tolman lengths of nanomaterials by adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics was presented. The interfacial tension and its temperature coefficient of the solid–liquid interface of nano cadmium sulfide before adsorption were obtained, and further, the Tolman length was also obtained. The experimental results show that the particle size of nanoparticles has significant effects on the interfacial tension and its temperature coefficient. When the radius is larger than 10 nm, the interfacial tension and its temperature coefficient are almost constant with the decrease of the radius. When the radius is less than 10 nm, the interfacial tension decreases sharply and the temperature coefficient increases sharply with the decrease of the radius, and the temperature coefficient of the interfacial tension is negative. The Tolman length of the solid–liquid interface of nanoparticles is proved to be positive, and the particle size also has a significant effect on the Tolman length. The Tolman length decreases with the decrease of particle size. However, the effects of particle size on the Tolman length become significant only when the particle radius approach or reach the order of magnitudes of molecular (or atomic) radius. The effects of particle size on interfacial tension and Tolman length of nano cadmium sulfide obtained in this paper can provide significant references for the research and applications of interface thermodynamics of other nanomaterials.
