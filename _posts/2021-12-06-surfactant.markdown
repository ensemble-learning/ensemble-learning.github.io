Ions are of central importance in nature, and a variety of potential models was proposed to model ions in different phases for an in-depth exploration of ion-related systems.

Here, we developed point charge models of 14 monovalent ions with the traditional 12–6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential for use in conjunction with 11 water models of TIP3P, OPC3, SPC/E, SPC/Eb, TIP3P-FB, a99SB-disp, TIP4P-Ew, OPC, TIP4P/2005, TIP4P-D, and TIP4P-FB.

The designed models reproduced the real hydration free energy (HFE) of ions and the ion-oxygen distance (IOD) in the first hydration shell accurately and simultaneously, a performance similar to the previously reported 12–6–4 LJ-type ion models (12–6 LJ plus an attractive C4 term for cations or a repulsive one for anions).

This work, along with our previous work on di-, tri-, and tetravalent metal cations (J. Chem.

In order for the 12–6 LJ potential to reproduce both the HFE and IOD, the LJ R parameters need to be close to Shannon’s ionic radii for the highly charged cations and to the Stokes’s van der Waals (vdW) radii for the monovalent ions.

With an additional C4 term, the R parameters of 12–6–4 LJ ion models agree well with the Stokes’s vdW radii and have a more physical meaning.

It appears that the C4 term can be merged into the 12–6 LJ potential by a rational tuning of R and the LJ well depth.

Simulations of the osmotic coefficients of alkali chloride solutions and the properties of gaseous and solid alkali halides indicate the necessity of further optimizing ion–ion interactions via, for instance, targeting more properties or using a more physical (polarizable) model.
