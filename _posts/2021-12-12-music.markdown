On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hairWarm smell of colitas, rising up through the airUp ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering lightMy head grew heavy and my sight grew dimI had to stop for the nightThere she stood in the doorway;I heard the mission bellAnd I was thinking to myself,"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the wayThere were voices down the corridor,I thought I heard them say...Welcome to the Hotel CaliforniaSuch a lovely place (Such a lovely place)Such a lovely facePlenty of room at the Hotel CaliforniaAny time of year (Any time of year)You can find it hereHer mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bendsShe got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friendsHow they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.Some dance to remember, some dance to forgetSo I called up the Captain,"Please bring me my wine"He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"And still those voices are calling from far away,Wake you up in the middle of the nightJust to hear them say...Welcome to the Hotel CaliforniaSuch a lovely place (Such a lovely place)Such a lovely faceThey livin' it up at the Hotel CaliforniaWhat a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)Bring your alibisMirrors on the ceiling,The pink champagne on iceAnd she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"And in the master's chambers,They gathered for the feastThey stab it with their steely knives,But they just can't kill the beastLast thing I remember, I wasRunning for the doorI had to find the passage backTo the place I was before"Relax, " said the night man,"We are programmed to receive.You can check-out any time you like,But you can never leave!
