from "The Dharma Bums""Japhy," I said out loud, I don't know when we'll meet again or what'll happen in the future, but Desolation, Desolation, I owe so much to Desolation.

Thank you for guiding me to the place I learned all.

Now comes the sadness of coming back to cities and I've grown two months older and there's all that humanity of bars and burlesque shows and gritty love, all upsidedown in the void God bless them, but Japhy you and me forever know, O ever youthful, O ever weeping."
