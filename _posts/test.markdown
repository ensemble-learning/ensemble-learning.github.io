It is revealed that the Tesla Semi truck will be mass-produced: equipped with 500 kWh battery pack, starting price of 150,000 US dollars

Tesla has released a Semi electric truck many years ago, which is also the largest Tesla model. Still, it has experienced several ticket skips and has not yet been officially launched.

However, this situation is expected to change this year.

According to relevant media reports, it has been reported recently that Tesla Semi will officially start mass production later this year and successfully achieve the first delivery within the year, with the battery capacity being changed to 500 kWh batteries.

It is reported that a Tesla Semi prototype was exposed some time ago. Compared with the previously exposed design, it has a lot of changes. The driver's pedals and door handles have been changed to traditional truck handles from the previously hidden type, and the overall design is closer to—the status of production vehicles.

In terms of power, Tesla said that the 0-96km/h acceleration time of the Semi is only 5 seconds at no-load, and the 0-96km/h acceleration time is 20 seconds under a 36-ton load.

According to previous news, Tesla plans to launch two models with different configurations.

When cruising with a full load of cargo (80,000 pounds of cargo, about 36 tons), the energy consumption per mile is less than two-kilowatt hours, which is significantly lower than that of heavy diesel trucks. It can achieve 300 miles (about 482 kilometers) and 500 miles ( About 804 kilometers) of cruising range with kinetic energy recovery.

Among them, the 300-mile version is priced at US$150,000, and the 500-mile version is priced at US$180,000. At the same time, this version also supports fast charging mode, which can have a range of 644km after charging for 30 minutes.
