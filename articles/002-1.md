# Abstract

# Introduction
Electricity from solar and wind power can now be produced in a financially sustainable way and can contribute to the conversion. But storing and transporting energy still pose a challenge. Here, catalytic processes may play a key role. For example, electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuels is a promising way in converting and storing renewable energy into chemical form, which is also environment-beneficial in decreasing the CO2 concentration in atmosphere.

The problem is that today we donâ€™t have catalysts effective enough to catalyze CO2 reduction (CO2RR). As far as now, Copper (Cu) is only single metal that can electrochemically reduce CO2 into hydrocarbons.
The problem of Cu:
1.  diverse production distribution;
2.  high overpotential;
The ideal catalysis will have high selectivity with low overpotential (or high current).

n-Pr-OH is the best production for the following reasons:
1.  reason 1
2.  reason 2
Therefore, the new generation of catalysis should be n-Pr-OH active.

The current performance is still too low to be useful.
The improvement is still very unlikely in the near future without a well understanding the reaction mechanism.

In this work, we predict the reaction mechanism of n-Pr-OH formation using the method we previously developed. These methods give us very good understanding about the reaction mechanism.

Basing on the experiment results and our instinct, forming two C-C bounds simultaneously is very unlikely. This is consistent with experiment. Thus the most possible pathway of Pr-OH formation is along C2 pathway.

We thus, test all the possible pathway of the second C-C bond formation along with the C-C pathway. The results is show in Figure 2.

Thus, we predicted that the second C-C bond formation is in the stage of CH2-C + CO.

We show the scheme here.

From CH2-C-CO to n-PrOH have 6 steps. we explode all the possible pathways and find the following reactions.

Now we give our suggestions.
1.  pH effect
2.  CO effect
