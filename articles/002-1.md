# Introduction
Renewable energy;
Renewable energy storage;
Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuels is a promising way in converting and storing renewable energy into chemical form, which also is environment-beneficial in decreasing the amount of CO2 in atmosphere.

As far as now, Copper (Cu) is only single metal that can electrochemically reduce CO2 into CxHy.
However, the performance is too low to be useful;
First, there are too many different productions
Second, the overpotential is too high.
The ideal catalysis will have high selectivity with low overpotential (or high current).

n-Pr-OH is the best production for the following reasons:
Therefore, the new generation of catalysis should be n-Pr-OH active.

The current performance is still too low to be useful.
The improvement is still very unlikely in the near future without a well understanding the reaction mechanism.

In this work, we predict the reaction mechanism of n-Pr-OH formation using the method we previously developed. These methods give us very good understanding about the reaction mechanism.

Basing on the experiment results and our instinct, forming two C-C bounds simultaneously is very unlikely. This is consistent with experiment. Thus the most possible pathway of Pr-OH formation is along C2 pathway.

We thus, test all the possible pathway of the second C-C bond formation along with the C-C pathway. The results is show in Figure 2.

Thus, we predicted that the second C-C bond formation is in the stage of CH2-C + CO.

We show the scheme here.

From CH2-C-CO to n-PrOH have 6 steps. we explode all the possible pathways and find the following reactions.

Now we give our suggestions.
