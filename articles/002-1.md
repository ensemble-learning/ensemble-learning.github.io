# Abstract

# Introduction
Electricity from solar and wind power can now be produced in a financially sustainable way and can contribute to the conversion. But storing and transporting energy still pose a challenge. Here, catalytic processes may play a key role. For example, electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuels is one promising way in converting and storing renewable energy into chemical form, which is also environment-beneficial in decreasing the CO2 concentration in atmosphere.

The problem is that today we don’t have catalysts effective enough to catalyze CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Until now, Copper (Cu) is the only single metal that can electrochemically reduce CO2 into hydrocarbons. At pH 6.8, up to 16 different productions has been reported in reducing CO2 using Cu poly-crystaline. At an applied potential of -1.05 V, the amounts of these products are: ethylene(CH2=CH2, 27%), methane(CH4, 26%), ethanol(CH3CH2OH, 11%), n-propanol(CH3CH2CH2OH, 4%), allyl alcohol (CH2=CHCH2OH, 2%), formate(HCO2-, 2%), monoxodie (CO, 1%),  acetaldehyde (CH3CHO, 0.4%), acetate (CH3COO−, 0.3%), glycolaldehyde(HOCH2-CHO, 0.3%), ethylene glycol(HO−CH2CH2−OH, 0.2%), acetone(CH3-CO-CH3, 0.1), methanol (CH3OH, <0.1%), propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO, <0.1%) and etc. Meanwhile, ~21% FE attributes to hydrogen evoluation reaction (HER) as the major competing reaction lowing the efficiecy. At pH 6.8, the standard reduction potentals of major productions (ethylene, methane, ethanol, n-propanol and ally alchoho)  are all positive (0.08, 0.17, 0.09, 0.21 and 0.11, repectively), thus themordynamically favorable, -0.75 for the onset, and -1.05 for current.
However, the performance of Cu on CO2RR is still far from meeting the requirment for any practical industrial applications. Instead, the ideal catalysis will have high selectivity with low overpotential (or high current).

Among all the hydrocarbon productions, n-Pr-OH is the ideal product. :
1.  reason 1
2.  reason 2
Therefore, the new generation of catalysis should be n-Pr-OH active.

The current performance is still too low to be useful.
The improvement is still very unlikely in the near future without a well understanding the reaction mechanism.

In this work, we predict the reaction mechanism of n-Pr-OH formation using the method we previously developed. These methods give us very good understanding about the reaction mechanism.

Basing on the experiment results and our instinct, forming two C-C bounds simultaneously is very unlikely. This is consistent with experiment. Thus the most possible pathway of Pr-OH formation is along C2 pathway.

We thus, test all the possible pathway of the second C-C bond formation along with the C-C pathway. The results is show in Figure 2.

Thus, we predicted that the second C-C bond formation is in the stage of CH2-C + CO.

We show the scheme here.

From CH2-C-CO to n-PrOH have 6 steps. we explode all the possible pathways and find the following reactions.

Now we give our suggestions.
1.  pH effect
2.  CO effect
