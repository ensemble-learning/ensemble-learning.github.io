A critical step towards rational design of new catalysts that achieve selective 
and efficient reduction of CO2 to specific hydrocarbons and oxygenates is to determine 
the detailed reaction mechanism including kinetics and product selectivity as a function 
of pH and applied potential for known systems. To accomplish this we apply ab initio 
molecular metadynamics simulations (AIMD) for the wa-ter/Cu(100) system with five layers 
of explicit solvent under a potential of -0.59 V (RHE) at pH 7 and compare to experiment. 
From these free energy calculations, we determined the kinetics and pathways for major 
products (ethylene and methane) and minor products (ethanol, glyoxal, glycoladehyde, 
ethylene glycol, acetal-dehyde, ethane and methanol).
