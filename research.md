- # CO2 reduction
{% include image.html url="/images/co2.png" caption="CO2 reduction on Cu(100)" width=300 align="right" %}
** A critical step towards rational design of new catalysts that achieve selective and efficient reduction of CO2 to specific hydrocarbons and oxygenates is to determine the detailed reaction mechanism including kinetics and product selectivity as a function of pH and applied potential for known systems. To accomplish this we apply ab initio molecular metadynamics simulations (AIMD) for the wa-ter/Cu(100) system with five layers of explicit solvent under a potential of -0.59 V (RHE) at pH 7 and compare to experiment. From these free energy calculations, we determined the kinetics and pathways for major products (ethylene and methane) and minor products (ethanol, glyoxal, glycoladehyde, ethylene glycol, acetal-dehyde, ethane and methanol). **

- # Fuel Cells

The sluggish Oxygen reduction reaction (ORRs) is a major impediment to economical use of fuel cells in transportation. In this work, we report the full ORR reaction mechanism for Pt(111) based on QM free energy calculations at 298K, including explicit water.

- # Accelerated Molecular Dynamics

We develop here the methodology for dramatically accelerating the ReaxFF reactive force field based reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations through use of the bond boost concept (BB), which we validate here for describing hydrogen combustion.
