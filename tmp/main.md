I suggest to accept this manuscript after minor revision.
In this work, the authors investigated the promotion effect of ionic liquid (IL) in CO2 conversion. By using a first-principle based multiscale simulation method, DFT-CES, they found that IL lower the formation energy of COOH by 0.31 eV compared with water. Further analysis showed that the microenvironment created by IL results in the promotion effect, which is different from previously proposed geometry stabilization effect. Moreover, they conducted experiments using IL with different combination of cations and anions to optimized the CO2 reduction performance.

DFT-CES significantly increase the size scale in simulation while keeping the accuracy by hybriding quantum mechanism calculation in the reaction part. I consider this multiscale method is advance in molecular simulation. I only have one minor comment:

1. The authors mentioned that DFT-CES can deal with polarizable effect. However, this is not clear to me. For example, the MM part is fixed charge model, which is unable to explicitly include any polarizable.
